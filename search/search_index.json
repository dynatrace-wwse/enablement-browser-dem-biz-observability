However, if you need some additional guidance on completing the business KPIs and writing the DQL queries, here are some tips:</p> <p>Typically the KPI is one of the types below:</p> <ul> <li>Success rate of the step (typically one where you\u2019ve defined an error) </li> <li>The time taken since a previous step</li> <li>Comparison to a historical value (e.g. orders packed per hour now vs yesterday) </li> </ul> <p>Choose one of these data KPI types and using the template DQL \u2013 populate the \u201cBusiness KPI\u201d tile, and also the description above the tiles. </p> <p>Time between two steps</p> <pre><code>fetch bizevents \n| filter event.provider == \"&lt;Your event provider&gt;\" \n| filter event.type == \"&lt;First event type&gt;\" or event.type == \"&lt;Second event type&gt;\" \n| summarize firstTime = takeMin(timestamp), secondTime = takeMax(timestamp), by:{&lt;Correlation ID&gt; } \n| filterOut isNull(firstTime) or isNull(secondTime) \n| fieldsAdd duration = secondTime - firstTime \n| summarize averageTime = avg(duration)\n</code></pre> <p>Success rate of step</p> <pre><code>fetch bizevents \n| filter event.provider == \"&lt;Your event provider&gt;\" \n| filter startsWith(event.type, \"&lt;event.type of your step that errors&gt;\") \n| summarize total = count(), success = countIf(event.type == \"&lt;event.type of your step that errors&gt;\") \n| fieldsAdd percentage = toDouble(success) / toDouble(total) * 100 \n</code></pre> <p>Comparison to previous time</p> <pre><code>fetch bizevents, from: -1h\n| filter event.provider == \"&lt;Your event provider&gt;\" and event.type == \"&lt;event.type of step in question&gt;\" \n| summarize valueNow= count(), by:{event.type} \n| lookup [fetch bizevents, from: -24h, to:-23h | filter event.provider == \"&lt;Your event provider&gt;\" and event.type == \"&lt;event.type of step in question&gt;\" | summarize previousValue = count(), by:{event.type} ], sourceField:event.type, lookupField:event.type \n| fieldsAdd percentageChange = ((toDouble(lookup.previousValue) - toDouble(valueNow)) / toDouble(valueNow)) * 100\n</code></pre> <p>Once this is done, populate the first \u201cgraph\u201d underneath the tiles at the top. Typically this first graph will be related in some way to the tile at the top. For example: </p> <p>If it\u2019s success rate: Line graph the success rate over time + A donut graph of \u201cfailure\u201d totals in different segments. </p> <p>If it\u2019s a time KPI, do something like: The time per segment in a line graph + The time per location in a categorical graph. </p> <p>If it\u2019s a comparison KPI: A line chart showing the value over time (possibly using thresholds to add some color).</p> <p>Next up is the graph at the bottom, this will be related to the step in some way but doesn\u2019t have to be directly tied to the KPI. Some of the popular choices are: </p> <p>Lost \u201cflows\u201d \u2013 for example mortgage applications that haven\u2019t been touched in X hours. Related to the above, what\u2019s the \u201crevenue\u201d impact of lost flows. Flows split by segment.</p> <p>Lost items</p> <pre><code>fetch bizevents \n| filter event.provider == \"&lt;Your event provider\n| filter event.type == \"&lt;First event type&gt;\" or event.type == \"&lt;Second event type&gt;\"\n| summarize firstCount = countIf(event.type == \"&lt;First event type&gt;\"), secondCount = countIf(event.type == \"&lt;Second event provider&gt;\"),firstTime = takeFirst(timestamp), by:{&lt;Correlation ID&gt; }\n| fieldsAdd timeSinceFirstStep = (now() - firstTime)\n| filter secondCount == 0 and timeSinceFirstStep &gt; toDuration(7200000000000) //Time in nanoseconds\n| makeTimeseries `Lost flows` = count(), time: firstTime, bins:50\n| fieldsAdd totalLostFlows = arraySum(`Lost flows`)\n</code></pre> <p>Here is the completed example, for Walmart's Online Order Fulfillment business process.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"6-business-observability-automation/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>TODO: summary</p>"},{"location":"snippets/admonitions/","title":"Admonitions","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This is a Note </p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>This is an abstract</p> <p>Tipp</p> <p>This is a tipp </p> <p>Success</p> <p>This is a success </p> <p>Question</p> <p>This is a success </p> <p>Failure</p> <p>This is a failure </p> <p>Danger</p> <p>This is a danger </p> <p>Info</p> <p>This is a info</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>This is a Warning </p> <p>This is an Example admonition</p> <p>This is an example</p> This is a bug and is collapsable <p>This is a bug</p>"},{"location":"snippets/disclaimer/","title":"Disclaimer","text":"<p>Support Policy</p> <p>This is an enablement project created by the Center of Excellence - Enablement Team at Dynatrace.
