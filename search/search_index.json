Through the Business Flow app, organizations can define and monitor key business processes\u2014like order fulfillment or loan applications\u2014using business events enriched with context from Dynatrace\u2019s Smartscape topology. Workflows can automatically trigger alerts, notifications, or remediation actions when anomalies or service level objectives (SLOs) are breached, ensuring timely responses to issues that impact business outcomes. For example, a Workflow might notify business teams and open a service ticket if the average order processing time exceeds a defined threshold, helping align IT operations with business performance goals.</p> <ul> <li>Learn More</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6-business-observability-automation/#configure-workflow","title":"Configure Workflow","text":"<p>In order to demonstrate end-to-end business process observability in this lab, we'll utilize a Dynatrace Workflow combined with Microsoft CoPilot.</p>"},{"location":"6-business-observability-automation/#download-workflow-assets","title":"Download Workflow Assets","text":"<p>Download the Workflow template and configuration code snippet.</p> <p>Workflow Template</p> <p>Configuration Code Snippet</p>"},{"location":"6-business-observability-automation/#update-code-snippet","title":"Update Code Snippet","text":"<p>Use Microsoft CoPilot to update the configuration code snippet.</p> <ul> <li>Open Microsoft CoPilot</li> </ul> <p>Start a new conversation with CoPilot.
