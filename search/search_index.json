Participants will gain practical experience by instrumenting Real User Monitoring (RUM) and Business Analytics directly from their local browser using a Chrome extension.</p> <p>The lab begins with a focus on the customer journey\u2014tracking real-time user interactions on a digital website to understand performance, usability, and experience metrics. Then, we\u2019ll shift to the business journey, automating observability across the full lifecycle of a business process using Workflow Automations, BizEvents, and Business Flows.</p> <p>By the end of the session, participants will understand how to:</p> <ul> <li>Differentiate between digital customer journeys and end-to-end business processes (journeys)</li> <li>Use Dynatrace RUM to monitor and analyze user behavior and experience</li> <li>Capture and correlate business events across distributed systems</li> <li>Build automated workflows to monitor business-critical processes</li> <li>Visualize and troubleshoot business flows to ensure continuity and performance</li> </ul> <p>Lab tasks:</p> <ol> <li>Customer Journey vs Business Journey</li> <li>Real User Monitoring<ul> <li>Configure Agentless RUM</li> <li>Configure Browser Extension</li> <li>Browse the website to begin data tracking</li> <li>Analyze Customer Journey</li> </ul> </li> <li>Business Observability with RUM<ul> <li>Capture BizEvent from Browser</li> <li>Analyze BizEvents</li> </ul> </li> <li>Business Journey Automation<ul> <li>Generate Business Flow using CoPilot</li> <li>Configure Dynatrace Workflow Automation</li> <li>Analyze Business Journey BizEvents</li> <li>Analyze Business Flow</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"#technical-specification","title":"Technical Specification","text":""},{"location":"#technologies-used","title":"Technologies Used","text":"<ul> <li>Dynatrace</li> <li>Technology with Link<ul> <li>Version Tested</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#reference-architecture","title":"Reference Architecture","text":"<p>N/A</p>"},{"location":"#continue","title":"Continue","text":"<p>In the next section, we'll review the prerequisites for this lab.</p> <ul> <li>Continue to getting started</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2-getting-started/","title":"2.
